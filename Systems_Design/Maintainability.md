# Maintainability

## Operability
Good operations team is responsible for the following:
health monitoring, root cause analysis of problems, keeping software and platforms up to date, tabs on how different systems affect each other, anticipating future problems, establishing good practices and tools, performing complex maintenance tasks, maintaining security
Good operability means:
providing visibility into runtime behavior
avoiding dependency on individual machines
good documentation and easy to understand operational model - "If I do X, Y will happen" 
good default behavior

## Simplicity
Abstract when possible 
Avoid complexity: explosion of state space, tight coupling modules, tangle dependencies, inconsistent naming, and terminology, adhoc fixes

## Evolvability
Consider agility when making software to adapt to new features, platforms and legal or regulatory requirements.
